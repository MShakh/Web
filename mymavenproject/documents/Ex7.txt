Kathantara  is a 2007 Indian Oriya film directed by Himansu Khatua, a story of tribulations of 1999 Orissa cyclone. Much before the Tsunami became a household name all over the world, the coastal belts of Orissa were hit by what has come to be known as the "Super Cyclone" that killed more than 10,000 people and rendered still more homeless. But public memory is short lived and it is a commendable effort on the part of the director Himansu Khatua to rake up the issue in his second feature film, perhaps the only Indian film that recalls those fateful days that changed the lives of so many people within a span of just a few days and its aftermath.
